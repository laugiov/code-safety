## Report Type

- [ ] **Expected vulnerability not working** - A documented vulnerability in VulnShop is not exploitable
- [ ] **False negative** - A tool should detect a vulnerability but doesn't
- [ ] **False positive** - A tool incorrectly reports a vulnerability
- [ ] **New vulnerability suggestion** - Suggest adding a new vulnerability
- [ ] **Detection improvement** - Improve detection accuracy
- [ ] **Infrastructure security issue** - Actual security issue in project infrastructure

## Vulnerability Details

### For VulnShop Issues

- **Vulnerability ID**: [e.g., V01, V02]
- **Vulnerability name**: [e.g., SQL Injection (Auth)]
- **File**: [e.g., authentication/views.py]
- **Line number**: [e.g., 15-25]

### For Detection Issues

- **Tool**: [Pysa / CodeQL / Semgrep]
- **Rule/Query**: [e.g., sql-injection.ql]
- **Expected behavior**: [Should detect / Should not detect]
- **Actual behavior**: [Detected / Not detected]

## Description

Detailed description of the issue.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Setup environment: `...`
2. Run command: `...`
3. Observe: `...`

## Evidence

### For False Negatives

Show that the vulnerability exists:

```python
# Vulnerable code snippet
```

```bash
# Exploitation command
curl "http://localhost:8000/..."
```

### For False Positives

Show that the code is actually safe:

```python
# Code flagged as vulnerable
```

Explanation of why this is safe: [...]

## Proposed Fix

If you have a suggestion for fixing this:

### For VulnShop

```python
# Corrected vulnerable code
```

### For Detection Rules

```yaml
# Improved rule
```

## Environment

- **Python version**: [e.g., 3.11.4]
- **Django version**: [e.g., 4.2.0]
- **Tool version**: [e.g., Semgrep 1.50.0]

## Additional Context

Any other relevant information.

**Note**: If you're reporting an actual security vulnerability in the project infrastructure (not the intentional VulnShop vulnerabilities), please consider responsible disclosure. For critical issues, contact maintainers directly.
